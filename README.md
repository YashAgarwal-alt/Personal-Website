Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website made using next.js bootstrapped with create next app

### How to run

In order to run the project, you can run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This launches the website on http://localhost:3000, open the link in a browser to see the project

Elements of the website have been inspired by Hosna Qasmei, emailjs documentation and the react Type animation documentation.
